# Movie Recommendation System
This is my movie recommendation system, created as a term project for CS634 (Data Mining) at NJIT.

The dataset used is from [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). Specifically, download both datasets under "recommended for education and development."
ml-latest-small.zip yields relevant files such as movies.csv and ratings.csv.
ml-latest.zip yields relevant files such as genome-scores.csv and genome-tags.csv.

Please read the final report to learn how to run the code!
